# Astronomical-Identification-ML
This is the repository that will host all the files related to my undergraduate Honors Capstone Project. My goal is to identify and classify astronomical phenomena by building a machine learning algorithm. 

Presently, I am pre-processing data using SExtractor. Eventually this repository will host all files from raw data to ML (DNN) algorithm. This is expected to be completed by the end of May 2023. Until then, the repo may be incomplete and documentation may not yet be substansive. Please reach out via <a href="https://andrewm.tech#three">andrewm.tech</a> with any questions.
