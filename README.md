# Astronomical-Identification-ML
This is the repository hosting all files related to my undergraduate Honors Capstone Project at Seattle Pacific University. The project develops a framework for training a Deep Neural Network in classifying astronomical images using labeled images from <a href="https://nova.astrometry.com">Astrometry</a> in tandem with <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor/">Source Extractor</a> as training data. 

Once given enough labeled data, the sourcing of images ought to be irrelevant with the relevant Source Extractor and <a href="https://www.astropy.org">AstroPy</a> methodologies still useful for creating two-dimensional vector cutouts of astronomical FITS files which can be fed to the model automatically.

Presently (May 2023), this repository is being configured to include relevant documents and files. Until this is complete, the repo may be incomplete and documentation may not yet be substansive. Please reach out via <a href="https://andrewm.tech#three">andrewm.tech</a> or email me at macphersona@spu.edu with any questions.
